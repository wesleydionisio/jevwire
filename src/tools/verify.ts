/**
 * `jev_verify` — check claims against supplied evidence, and only that evidence.
 *
 * One Choice per claim over supported / contradicted / not_addressed. The whole
 * point of the rubric is the third option: without it the model is forced to
 * pick a side on a claim the evidence never mentions.
 *
 * `evidence_path` is the cheap way in. The caller names the file it wants its
 * draft held to and the server reads it, so the evidence never passes through
 * the caller's context on its way to being checked. Evidence too large for one
 * request is split, every claim is judged against every piece, and the pieces
 * are merged in code — because "which chunk was most sure" is arithmetic, and
 * arithmetic is not something to ask a classifier.
