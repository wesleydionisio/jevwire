/**
 * `jev_next_step` — agent control flow as a judgment plus a policy.
 *
 * One request asks what to do next and four supporting yes/no questions. Code
 * then overrides the choice where a model must not have the last word: it may
 * not declare the goal done unless the completion signal is confidently yes,
 * and it may not retry forever. The attempt count never goes to the model —
 * Jev does not compare numbers reliably, so the cap is enforced in code.
