/**
 * `jev_rank` — relevance-rank candidate texts, or the caller's own files,
 * against a query.
 *
 * One Noul per candidate, batched into as few requests as the context budget
 * allows. The model never sees candidate ids: ids are arbitrary caller strings
 * and would be both a distractor in the state and unsafe as question keys, so
 * candidates go in as an index-keyed array and the indices are mapped back to
 * ids in code.
 *
 * With `paths` or `glob` the server does the reading. That is the whole point
 * of those two arguments: the caller spends no context emitting file text and
 * none ingesting the chunks that turned out to be irrelevant. What comes back
 * is `path:start-end` plus a score, so a 400-file search costs the caller a few
 * hundred tokens of output. File text is never echoed back, in either mode.

 *
 *   per request | requests | input tokens | best true-hit rank | top-median spread
 *            53 |        3 |      103,448 | not in the top six |              0.03

 * as unrelated state grows. At 53 per request the scores were uniform noise
 * between 0.84 and 0.87.
 *
 * It costs nothing to fix. The candidate texts are the whole of the payload and
 * each is sent exactly once either way; only the query and the one-line
 * questions repeat, which measured as a 2.5% token increase and *lower*
 * wall-clock time, because ten requests across an eight-wide fan-out finish
 * sooner than three big ones.
 *
 * The budget check still applies: a request is whichever is smaller, this many
 * candidates or as many as fit.
