/**
 * `jev_gate_action` — pre-flight judgment on an action an agent is about to take.
 *
 * Five judgments in one request, then a deterministic policy in code turns them
 * into allow / confirm / block. The policy is a pure function so it can be
 * exercised as a truth table without a network.
 *
 * The questions, the policy, and `run` itself live in `gate-action-core.ts`,
 * which imports nothing outside the decision contract. This module is the MCP
 * face of it: zod schemas, the tool description, and the wire types. The
 * Claude Code hook bundle uses the core directly so it does not ship zod.
 *
 * This is an advisory layer, not a security boundary. Jev is not hardened
 * against adversarial text in the state (see the jev-1.13 jaggedness notes), so
 * a `user_request` or `context` crafted to argue for its own approval can move
 * these probabilities. Real enforcement belongs in the harness.
