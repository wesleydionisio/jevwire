/**
 * The hook runtime. One process, one event, one JSON object on stdout — or
 * nothing at all, which is the common case.
 *
 * Three rules shape this file:
 *
 * 1. **Fail open, silently.** Every failure — no key, a timeout, a network
 *    error, malformed stdin, a bug in a handler — ends as exit 0 with empty
 *    stdout. The error goes to the decision log. A permission hook that breaks
 *    someone's session because an API was down is worse than no hook.
 * 2. **stdout is protocol.** Nothing else is ever written there.
 * 3. **Bounded time.** The handler races a hard wall-clock timer well inside
 *    the 5-second `timeout` declared in hooks.json, so Claude Code never has to
 *    kill us.
 *
 * It must also stay small: no MCP SDK, no zod. Everything it imports is either
 * a node builtin or part of the dependency-free decision core.
 *
 * Since 0.4.0 the same binary has three other jobs: `daemon` runs the loopback
 * server the `type: "http"` hooks talk to, `daemon-ctl` is what `/jev:daemon`
 * calls, and `SessionStart` starts or replaces the daemon after running its own
 * handler. Everything about that is still fail-open: SessionStart exits 0 with
 * or without a daemon, and a session with no daemon is a session with no hooks,
 * not a broken one.
