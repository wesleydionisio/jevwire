/**
 * Who may post a hook payload to the daemon.
 *
 * The daemon binds to loopback, so the threat is not the network: it is another
 * process on the same machine — a different local user, or anything that can
 * make an HTTP request — feeding the plugin tool calls it never saw, or reading
 * them back. The shared secret is the TypeSafe API key, because it is the one
 * value both ends already have: `hooks.json` interpolates it into the request
 * headers and `loadHookConfig` reads it in the daemon.
 *
 * Two headers, either of which is accepted (0.6.0 adds two more below):
 *
 *   Authorization: Bearer $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_API_KEY
 *   X-Jev-Env-Key: $TYPESAFE_API_KEY
 *
 * plus two more for the OpenRouter provider, accepted the same way:
 *
 *   X-Jev-Option-Key-OpenRouter: $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
 *   X-Jev-Env-Key-OpenRouter: $OPENROUTER_API_KEY
 *
 * All are sent on every hook, and usually only one of them has a value: the
 * spike showed `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_API_KEY` interpolating to the empty string
 * when the plugin option is unset (leaving a bare `Bearer `), while a key
 * exported in the user's shell arrives in the second. An empty credential is
 * therefore *absent*, not wrong — treating it as wrong would lock out every
 * install that sets the key in only one of the two places.
 *
 * The daemon holds every key present in its environment — the plugin option,
 * `JEV_PLUGIN_API_KEY` and `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` — and accepts a credential
 * matching any of them. The option and the shell can legitimately hold
 * different keys, and the hooks interpolate one of each, so an install that
 * rotated one half and not the other still has a daemon that knows both.
 *
 * With no key configured anywhere the daemon runs unauthenticated. That is not
 * a hole being waved through: with no key there is nothing to spend and no
 * judgment to make, so the daemon has no secret to leak and nothing to do. It
 * says so in `/v1/health` as `auth: "none"` rather than implying otherwise.
